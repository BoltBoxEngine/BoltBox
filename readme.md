<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

</div>

My friends and I loved playing jackbox, however we found ourselves contemplating new game types that could be added, and were met with a lack of resources to easily and quickly implement them, enter BoltBox.

BoltBox is complex under the hood but makes implementing games easy and quick:

- New games can be remotely installed using NPM
- All games can have extensions installed adding new content to the (extra lines or promts for example)
- Keep game devolpement simple and fun while being extendable and modular

This project is still heavily under devolpement and has a long way to go so help and patience is highly appreciated!
